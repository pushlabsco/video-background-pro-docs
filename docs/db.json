The container tells the plugin where to place the video background.\n\n## What Is a Container?\n\nA container in Video Background Pro is nothing more than a [CSS Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp). A [selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) allow you to specify what element on a webpage you want to target. If you are new to selectors, I highly recommend taking a look at this w3schools article [CSS Syntax and Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp). It will save you a lot of time looking for your container.\n\n## How Do I Find My Container?\n\nIn order to find your container, you'll need a browser with developer tools. I would recommend using Google Chrome for this.\n\n1. Start by hovering your mouse over the area in which you want the video background to appear.\n2. Right click and select the **inspect** menu item. This will open the developer tools.\n3. You'll notice a new window pops up with a hierarchical list of elements to the left. This is called the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp). It is a tree of HTML elements. One of these elements is your container.\n4. Since you were hovering over the area where you want your video background to be placed, the selected element should be close, if not correct. You'll know that the selected element is your container when you hover over it, and blue and or green fill up the entire area of where you want the video background to be placed. Feel free to watch the tutorial above for a more in depth demonstration.\n\n[For an in depth dive into finding selectors, take a look at this tutorial by Google.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom/)\n\n\n## Once I Have Found My Container, How Do I Reference It?\n\nSay we have found the element you want to target for a video background, and it looks like this:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"masthead\" class=\"site-header\">\n    ...\n</div>\n```\n\nIn Video Background Pro, you can reference this element two ways:\n\n* By the id attribute\n* By the class attribute\n\n**In HTML, id attributes have to be unique while classes can be used multiple times throughout the web page.**\n\nBecause of this, it is best to reference the ID over the class, as it has less of a chance of conflicting with other elements.\n\nWhen referring to an ID in Video Background Pro, it must be prefixed by a hashtag. This let's the browser know that you are trying to reference an ID. So you would enter the following in the Video Background Pro container field:\n\n```css\n#masthead\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you wanted to reference the class, you would prefix it with a period:\n\n```css\n.site-header\n```"},{"url":"/using-the-shortcode/","title":"Using the Shortcode","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Video Background Pro Docs","url":"/"},{"title":"Using the Shortcode","url":"/using-the-shortcode/"}],"content":"\n# Using the Shortcode\n\nThe shortcode is the backbone of the entire Video Background Pro plugin.

This is where your video background will go. This parameter is required. | Any | Any DOM Element | `\"\"`\n| type | The type of video background you would like. | Any | self-host, youtube, vimeo | \"self-host\"\n| mp4 | The .mp4 file link. | `self-host` | Any URL with an `.mp4` file extension. | \"null\"\n| webm | The .webm file link. | `self-host` | Any URL with a `.webm` file extension. | \"null\"\n| youtube_url | The YouTube URL. Can be any type of YouTube URL (shortened, regular, embed, etc).| `youtube` | Any YouTube video URL. | \"null\"\n| youtube_start | The YouTube video background start second. This must be a number, not the minutes and seconds. For example, if you want the video to start at 1:32, you would input 92. | `youtube` | A number less than the total amount of seconds in the YouTube video. | \"0\"\n| youtube_end | The YouTube video background end second. This must be a number, not the minutes and seconds. For example, if you want the video to end at 1:32, you would input 92. | `youtube` | A number less than the total amount of seconds in the YouTube video. | \"null\"\n| vimeo_url | The Vimeo video URL. | `vimeo` | A Vimeo Video URL ex. https://vimeo.com/xxxx where \"xxxx\" is the ID. | \"null\"\n| poster | The poster image will be shown while the video is loading and for devices/browsers that do not support video backgrounds. | Any | Any URL to an image. .png and .jpg are recommended. | \"null\"\n| end_frame_poster | This option will add the poster image to the video background once it stops playing. The `loop` parameter must be set to `false` for this to work. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"false\"\n| muted | This option has been depreciated due to browser restrictions. As of Video Background Pro 3.0.0 this option will no longer do anything. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"true\"\n| loop | This option will dictate whether or not the video background will loop. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"true\"\n| overlay | To enable the overlay or not. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"false\"\n| overlay_color | Specify the color of the overlay as a hex color. The `overlay` parameter must be set to `true` for this to take effect. | Any | Any Hex color. | \"#000\"\n| overlay_alpha | Specify the amount of transparency your overlay will have. This can be useful for text legibility. | Any | A value between `0.00` and `1.00` where `0.00` is completely transparent and `1.00` begin opaque. | \"0.3\"\n| overlay_texture_url | This option was depreciated in Video Background Pro 4.0.0, and will no longer do anything. | Any | Any URL to an image. | \"#\"\n| frontend_play_button | Toggle a play/pause button for the video background. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"false\"\n| frontend_volume_button | Toggle a mute/unmute button for the video background. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"false\"\n| frontend_position | Specify the position of the frontend buttons. Either `frontend_play_button`, `frontend_volume_button` or both must be enabled. | Any | `bottom-right`, `bottom-left`, `top-right`, `top-left` | \"bottom-right\"\n| enable_loader | This option was depreciated in Video Background Pro 4.0.0, and will no longer do anything. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"false\"\n| play_on_mobile | This option was depreciated in Video Background Pro 4.0.0, and will no longer do anything. Now, the video background will play on any mobile browser that supports HTML5 `<video>`. | Any | `true` or `false` | \"true\"\n| player_options | Allows you to interact with the player's API. Can be used for `self-host`, `youtube`, and `vimeo` video backgrounds. Make a JSON string of an object with the options that you would like to add/override. | Any | A JSON String with an object of key:value pairs. | \"null\"\n| frontend_container | Use this option if you'd like to re-position your frontend buttons. Used just like the `container` parameter, simply provide a DOM element for it to be moved to. | Any | Any DOM Element | \"null\"\n\n## Constructing the Shortcode\n\nWhen you are constructing the shortcode, you only need to add the parameters that matter to you.

This means that if the container is an element with 50 pixels in width and height, that will be the size of the video background. **Additionally, if your container's height is 0 pixels or it does not have any content inside of it, the video background will not show up since the container is essentially non-existent.**\n\nThe best way to control the size of the container is to use CSS. Say you have a container:\n```html\n<div class=\"my-video-background\">\n    ...\n</div>\n```\n\nThat means that you can use the CSS selector `.my-video-background` to modify the height of the container:\n\n```css\n.my-video-background {\n    height: 500px;\n}\n```\n\nThis code, however, is not very responsive.

It is always smart to copy the URL you are using for Video Background Pro, and paste it into an incognito browser window. If the video does not play, there is an issue with the URL.\n\n## YouTube Video Must Be Publicly Accessible\n\nThe YouTube video that you want as a video background must be publicly accessible. This means that the video must be either public or unlisted, but can **NOT** be private. You can make sure your YouTube video is publicly accessible by visiting your YouTube video URL in an incognito window to see if it plays.\n\n## YouTube Plugin Conflict\n\nIf you have checked the previous recommendations and they were not the cause of the issue, you may be experiencing an YouTube plugin conflict. This means that you have another plugin installed that is using the YouTube API that is conflicting with Video Background Pro. It is best to deactivate any YouTube plugins one by one on your WordPress site to rule out which plugin is causing the conflict."},{"url":"/examples/add-video-background-to-every-page/","title":"Add Video Background To Every Page","breadcrumbs":[{"title":"Video Background Pro Docs","url":"/"},{"title":"Examples"},{"title":"Add Video Background To Every Page","url":"/examples/add-video-background-to-every-page/"}],"content":"# Adding a Video Background to Every Page\n\nIn some instances, you may want a video background on every page of your WordPress site.
