{"title":"Using WPBakery","content":"\n# Using WPBakery to Create a Video Background\n\nWPBakery is a great tool to create website elements without much coding experience. Thankfully, Video Background Pro has a great WPBakery integration that lets you add video backgrounds through WPBakery `Row` elements.\n\n**First thing is first, you'll want to have content in your row before you start. Since the video background is sized according to the container, if there is no content, the height will be `0`.**\n\nHere are the steps to create a video background successfully with WPBakery:\n\n1. Make sure WPBakery is installed in `WordPress Admin > Plugins`\n2. Navigate to the page you would like the video background to appear on\n3. Make sure you are using the WPBakery **Backend Editor**\n4. Create a row by selecting the **plus icon**, then selecting the **Row** item\n5. Select the **pencil icon** in the top-right corner of the row to bring up the settings\n6. Click the **Video Background** tab, and fill in the fields as necessary.\n7. Save changes\n\nCongrats, you've added a video background through WPBakery!"}
