{"title":"Add Video Background To Every Page","content":"# Adding a Video Background to Every Page\n\nIn some instances, you may want a video background on every page of your WordPress site. This is very straight forward thanks to the `[vidbg]` shortcode.\n\nYou can do so by pasting this function at the bottom of your `functions.php` file:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Add a video background to every page/post\n * \n * @version 05222018\n * @author Push Labs\n * @link https://pushlabs.co\n */\nfunction theme_prefix_vidbg_every_page() {\n  // Add [vidbg] params as needed. Be sure to change the container to your desired container.\n  echo do_shortcode('[vidbg container=\".YOUR_CONTAINER_HERE\" mp4=\"#\" webm=\"#\"]');\n}\nadd_action('wp_footer', 'theme_prefix_vidbg_every_page');\n```"}
