# Auto Playback with Audio

Due to Chrome, Safari, and other browsers' policy of disabling auto-playing video with sound, Video Background Pro has decided to remove the `muted` parameter, and now will always start video backgrounds with the sound muted.

Video Background Pro still offers the frontend volume button, however, and can be toggled by your users to mute/unmute the audio of the video background.
