# Mobile Playback Issues

Video Background Pro will play on any device/browser that supports HTML5 `<video>`. As of August 2019, compatibility is at [97.25% globally amongst all users](https://caniuse.com/#feat=video). This is phenomenal support, but sometimes you may still see the video not playing on mobile. Here are a few things to look into if you are experiencing this issue.

## Device Low Power Mode

Devices on low power mode usually will automatically disable auto-playing video to save battery power. This is certainly the case with Apple devices like iPhone and iPad, and a lot of Android devices as well.

## Device Doesn't Support Video Codecs

There are some cases where the codec that was used to create the video is not supported. Please visit our docs on File Types and Codecs for more information.
