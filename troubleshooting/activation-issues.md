# Fixing Activation Issues

It is possible for the activation process to get stuck in limbo if the server connection times out or if the connection is interrupted.

If this happens, there are a few steps you can take to revert the activation, and try again. Start with the following steps:

1. Deactivate Video Background Pro under `WordPress Admin > Plugins`
2. Go to [your API Keys](https://pushlabs.co/my-account/my-api-keys/) and remove any keys for the domain you are trying to activate
3. Reactivate Video Background Pro under `WordPress Admin > Plugins`
4. Enter your license key and email found on the [API Keys page](https://pushlabs.co/my-account/my-api-keys/)

This should allow you to activate the plugin successfully. Otherwise, please reach out and we can assist with activation.
