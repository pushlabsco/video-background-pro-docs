# Using SiteOrigin Page Builder to Create a Video Background

SiteOrigin Page Builder is a great tool to create website elements without much coding experience in WordPress. Thankfully, Video Background Pro has a great SiteOrigin integration that lets you add video backgrounds through SiteOrigin Page Builder's `Row` widgets.

**First thing is first, you'll want to have content in your row before you start. Since the video background is sized according to the container, if there is no content, the height will be `0`.**

1. Make sure SiteOrigin Page Builder is installed in `WordPress Admin > Plugins`
2. Navigate to the page you would like the video background to appear on
3. Click the **Page Builder** tab
4. Create a row by selecting the **Add Row** button
5. You will be prompted to select the amount of columns you want in your row. Select the correct amount and click the **insert** button
6. Edit the row by hovering over the **wrench icon** in the top-right hand corner of the row and selecting **Edit Row**
7. Click the **Video Background** tab, and fill in the fields as necessary.
8. Save changes
