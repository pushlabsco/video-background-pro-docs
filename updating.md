# Updating

Updating the plugin will allow you to keep up-to-date with new features and improvements. Since modern browsers are constantly changing, it's important to have the latest version so your video backgrounds are compatible with browsers and devices.

Since version 2.1.0, Video Background Pro has a built in update tool that will look for updates and can be updated right from the native WordPress plugins page. This means that keeping up-to-date in Video Background Pro can be done in a matter of a few clicks. In order for this to work, it's important that you activate your plugin.

## Updating the Plugin Manually

It is also possible to update the plugin manually by downloading the Video Background Pro update from the [downloads section of your Push Labs account](https://pushlabs.co/my-account/my-api-downloads/), and uploading the files through FTP to `/wp-content/plugins/video-background-pro`.
