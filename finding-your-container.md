# Finding Your Container

## Overview

Finding your container may be the most important aspect of using Video Background Pro. The container tells the plugin where to place the video background.

### What is a "container"?

Simply, a "container" in Video Background Pro is nothing more than an HTML Selector. A selector allow you to specify what element on a webpage you want to target. If you are new to selectors, I highly recommend taking a look at this w3schools article [CSS Syntax and Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp). It will save you a lot of time looking for your "container."
